# Harry Potter Dataset Cleaning
 Cleaned Harry Potter text dataset. I made this a long time ago, and, unfortunately, was unable to find the original dataset. It contained the 100% raw text data from every single Harry Potter book in seperate files. 
 I had to combine these files and convert them into something more readable and useable for ML tasks. Looking back, I could have done this more efficiently. 

 Outside of these Python files, I also made many changes in a seperate text editor using Regular Expressions.
